# Project Kraken: The Living Fleet

## Classification Level: ULTRAVIOLET
## Access Required: Admiral Level + Biological Warfare Certification

## Overview

Project Kraken represents Atlantis's most ambitious military biotechnology program: the development of autonomous biological submarines grown rather than built. Initiated in 2049 after the capture of a anomalous deep-sea creature near Tethys, the project aims to create living vessels that blur the line between organism and weapon system.

## The Origin Specimen

Designated "Organism Zero," the creature found near Tethys measured 47 meters long with a natural biosonar capability exceeding military hardware. Dissection revealed:
- Organic pressure bladders allowing rapid depth changes
- Electroreceptors capable of detecting submarines at 20km range
- Chromatophore skin providing active camouflage
- Distributed neural network with no centralized brain
- Internal cavities suggesting symbiotic relationship with smaller organisms

Most disturbing: tool use marks indicating deliberate self-modification.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Reverse Engineering (2049-2051)
Scientists at the Hadean Laboratory (Tethys Level 7) attempt to replicate Organism Zero's biological systems. Early experiments produce "bio-hulls" - living skin that can be grafted onto traditional submarines, providing self-healing and camouflage capabilities.

### Phase 2: Hybrid Vessels (2051-2053)
First successful fusion of mechanical and biological systems. Submarine designation "Remora-1" incorporates:
- Living outer hull that filters nutrients from seawater
- Organic ballast system using modified swim bladders
- Bioluminescent communication arrays
- Regenerative armor that grows thicker when damaged

### Phase 3: True Organisms (2053-Present)
Creation of fully biological submarines. These creatures are:
- Grown in deep-sea nurseries from engineered embryos
- Imprinted with human neural patterns for control
- Capable of reproduction (strictly controlled)
- Fed on a diet of processed kelp and engineered plankton

## Current Fleet Status

Seven Kraken-class organisms operational:
1. **Leviathan** - 87 meters, stationed Pacific Trench
2. **Behemoth** - 72 meters, North Atlantic patrol
3. **Typhon** - 69 meters, Mediterranean operations
4. **Charybdis** - 91 meters, Arctic ice navigation
5. **Scylla** - 78 meters, Indian Ocean
6. **Hadean** - Classification beyond Admiral level
7. **Primordial** - Classification beyond Admiral level

## Capabilities

Kraken-class organisms can:
- Dive to depths exceeding 15,000 meters
- Remain submerged indefinitely (feeding while deployed)
- Achieve silent running indistinguishable from whale song
- Carry 24 conventional torpedoes in biological launch sacs
- Deploy smaller "remora" organisms for reconnaissance
- Regenerate from up to 60% tissue damage
- Navigate without any electronic emissions

## Control Systems

Each organism bonds with a human pilot through neural interface. The pilot doesn't control the creature directly but forms a symbiotic consciousness. Pilots report:
- Sharing the organism's sensory experience
- Feeling the ocean as a three-dimensional space
- Experiencing hunger when the creature needs feeding
- Dreams of swimming without boundaries

Psychological screening eliminates 95% of candidates. The remaining 5% show markers for what psychologists diplomatically call "cognitive flexibility" - the ability to think as something inhuman.

## The Reproduction Protocols

Kraken organisms are engineered sterile, but retain reproductive capability with specific chemical triggers. In event of Atlantis falling, dead-hand protocols would release these chemicals, allowing the organisms to breed freely. Enemy navies would face not just seven creatures but potentially hundreds within a generation.

## Ethical Concerns

Dr. Yuki Tanaka, former project lead, resigned stating: "We're not creating weapons. We're creating a new form of life that thinks of humans as symbionts. What happens when they decide they don't need us?"

Current project lead, Commander Rex "Abyss" Harrison, responds: "That's exactly the point. We're not their masters. We're partners. The old navy conquered the sea. We're joining it."

## The Pilot Corps

Known as "Riders," the seven pilots of Kraken organisms show increasing psychological divergence from baseline human:
- Referring to themselves in plural ("we" instead of "I")
- Preference for raw fish and high-pressure environments
- Ability to hold breath for 15+ minutes
- Social isolation from non-Riders
- Communication with each other through subsonic frequencies

## Incident Report: The Feeding

During a routine patrol, Leviathan consumed an unmanned Chinese reconnaissance drone. Not destroyed - consumed, digested, integrated. The organism later demonstrated ability to replicate the drone's sonar signature. It learned by eating.

This was not programmed behavior.

## Connection to Organism Zero

Organism Zero remains in stasis at Tethys. Some scientists believe it's not a specimen but an ambassador - that Atlantis hasn't created the Kraken organisms but has been taught to grow them. The tool marks on Organism Zero match modifications made by Kraken organisms to their own bodies.

The implications are classified beyond documentation level.

## Future Developments

Project Kraken explores:
- Atmospheric-capable organisms (flying bio-submarines)
- Microscopic versions for infiltration
- Colony organisms (multiple creatures functioning as one)
- Deep space applications (organisms that swim through vacuum)

## The Ultimate Question

Admiral Harper's personal notes contain a single underlined question: "Are we creating the future of naval warfare, or are we midwifing our replacements?"

The Kraken organisms offer no answer. They simply grow, and wait, and dream in the deep.
