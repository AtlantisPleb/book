# Tethys: The Abyssal City

## Location and Purpose

Three kilometers below Heliopolis, where sunlight never reaches, lies Tethys - Atlantis's most classified installation. Built into the walls of the Puerto Rico Trench, Tethys serves as both deep-ocean research station and maximum-security archive for the Republic's most dangerous secrets.

Unlike Heliopolis's organic curves, Tethys is angular, crystalline - built from pressure-forged synthetic diamond and tungsten carbide. No bio-concrete here; the pressure would crush even the most adapted organisms. The city glows with bioluminescent cultivation tanks, the only light in the eternal darkness.

## Population

Only 300 citizens have clearance for Tethys. They serve two-year rotations, psychological evaluation mandatory every month. The pressure changes human psychology - residents report dreams of swimming through solid walls, of breathing water, of hearing voices in the thermal vent emissions.

**The Adapted**: After six months, residents undergo physiological changes. Pupils dilate permanently. Skin becomes translucent. Some develop primitive echolocation. The Navy studies these adaptations for potential military applications.

## Architecture

Tethys consists of seven spheres connected by transparent tunnels:

1. **Command Sphere** - Navigation, life support, and communication with surface
2. **Archive Sphere** - Contains pre-war data from every major government, obtained through means the Republic won't acknowledge
3. **Research Sphere** - Studies extremophile organisms and pressure-based weapons
4. **Habitat Sphere** - Living quarters designed to prevent catastrophic decompression psychosis
5. **Manufacturing Sphere** - Produces materials impossible to create at surface pressure
6. **The Black Sphere** - Contents classified above Admiral level
7. **Garden Sphere** - Chemosynthetic gardens that process sulfur from volcanic vents

## The Pressure Forge

Tethys's primary strategic asset: the Pressure Forge, using the ocean's weight to create materials science deemed impossible. Current projects include:
- Room-temperature superconductors
- Self-assembling carbon nanotubes
- Metallic hydrogen containment
- Theoretical "strange matter" experiments

## The Deep Adapted

Rumors persist of a permanent population that never surfaces - humans so changed by depth they can't survive normal pressure. Called "Hadal Sapiens" in classified documents, they supposedly maintain Tethys's deepest systems, communicating only through hydrophone transmissions.

Dr. Sarah Montgomery, Tethys's chief psychologist, notes in her logs: "They were human once. Now they're something between. Not evolution - too fast for that. Transformation. The ocean doesn't just pressure the body; it pressures the soul into new shapes."

## The Whisper Arrays

Tethys monitors deep ocean sounds through arrays of hypersensitive hydrophones. Most recordings are geological - tectonic shifts, underwater landslides. But Catalog Seven contains anomalies: structured sounds from trenches thought lifeless, patterns that suggest communication, frequencies that damage human neurology when played at surface pressure.

## Project Leviathan

The city's most classified project seeks to weaponize water pressure itself. Theoretical "pressure bombs" could create localized implosion zones, crushing enemy submarines instantly. Test footage shows metal spheres compacting to the size of marbles in milliseconds.

## Connection to the Architect

Chen's final transmissions originated near Tethys's location. Some believe he didn't disappear but descended, that the Black Sphere contains his laboratory where he conducts experiments too extreme for surface ethics. The city's crystalline architecture shows suspicious similarities to deep-sea creature skeletons found nowhere in nature.

## Cultural Impact

Tethys appears in Atlantean nightmares and myths. Children whisper about the "Deep Ones" who guard the city. Artists paint abstract interpretations of the pressure dreams reported by returning residents. The phrase "sent to Tethys" has become slang for disappearing someone permanently.

## The Depth Protocols

Any surface dweller visiting Tethys must follow strict protocols:
- 72-hour compression period in staged chambers
- Surgical implantation of pressure equilibrium devices
- Psychological conditioning to prevent "depth rapture"
- Memory modification upon return (officially denied)

## Strategic Value

Tethys gives Atlantis absolute dominance of deep ocean warfare. Enemies can't attack what they can't reach. The city's existence itself is psychological warfare - land nations know Atlantis has capabilities in the deep but can only guess at their extent.

## The Question

As one returning researcher wrote before her memories were officially "counseled": "Tethys isn't built to keep the ocean out. It's built to keep something in. The real question isn't what we're studying down there, but what's studying us."
