  About This Template
  By default, when compiled (File > Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle ebook.
  How To Use This Template
  -720
 	 	Inside the 93Manuscript94 folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don92t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to97and indeed shouldn92t97title the folders 93Chapter One94 and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title 93Chapter94.-1440
 	 	
 Note
 : The 93Manuscript94 folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the 93Draft folder94. It92s just been renamed 93Manuscript94 in this template.-720
 	 	Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the 93#94 character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)	 	Information about characters can be placed in the 93Characters94 folder, and information about locations can be placed in the 93Places94 folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents > Change Icon feature.)	 	Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the 93Template Sheets94 folder.-1440
 	 	You should not edit the documents in the 93Template Sheets94 folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do97you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).	 	To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template > Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.	 	Alternatively, you can just click 93Add94, or hit cmd-N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.	 	You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:-2160
 	1.	Select the 93Bookmarks94 pane in the Inspector.	2.	If necessary, click on 93Document Bookmarks94 at the top and switch to 93Project Bookmarks94.	3.	Click on the chevron next to the 93Characters94 or 93Places94 folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view. (Note that only folders with content show chevrons.)-720
 	 	A 93Notes94 folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project > Project Settings, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
 
  Compiling
  -720
 	 	Title pages and front matter are all provided in the 93Front Matter94 folder (between the 93Places94 and 93Notes94 folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.	 	Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference panel and have it open alongside the Compile panel if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
 -720
 	 	
 To compile to standard manuscript format:
 -1440

 	Edit the 93Title Page94 document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use information from Contacts).	
  
 	Go to File > Compile85	
  
 	Next to 93Compile for94, select 93Print94, 93PDF94 or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.	
  
 	Select either 93Manuscript (Courier)94 or 93Manuscript (Times)94 from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you chosen).	
  
 	Ensure that the 93Add front matter94 button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the 93Manuscript Format94 folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)	
  
 	Click on 93Compile94.
 -720
 	 	
 To compile to paperback PDF format:-1440

 	Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.	
  
 	Go to File > Compile85	
  
 	Next to 93Compile for94, select 93PDF94.	
  
 	Select 93Paperback (5.0694 x 7.8194)94 from the list of formats on the left.	
  
 	Ensure that the 93Add front matter94 button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the 93Paperback94 folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it if it. (This has already been set up for you.)	
  
 	Click on 93Compile94.
 -720
 	 	
 To compile to ebook format:
 -1440

 	Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/EBook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.	
  
 	Import a cover image (preferably in JPG or PNG format).-2160
 	 	You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the 93EBook94 front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided97you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.	 	Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels, based on Amazon92s recommended size and proportions for a Kindle cover at the time this template was created.-1440

 	Go to File > Compile85	
  
 	From the 93Compile for94 menu, select one of the ebook formats.-2160
 	 	To create an ePub file, choose the 93ePub 394 format.	 	To create a Kindle file, choose the 93Kindle KF8/Mobi94 format.	 	93ePub 294 and 93Kindle Mobi94 are older versions of the formats. They are mainly provided for supporting projects created in older versions of Scrivener.-1440

 	Select 93Ebook94 from the list of formats on the left.	
  
 	If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the 93Add front matter94 button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the 93Ebook94 folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don92t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick 93Add front matter94. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)	
  
 	Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:-2160
 	 	Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.	 	Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.-1440

 	Click on 93Compile94.
 
  Making Changes
  There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:-720
 	 	
 Project and author name:
  The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).-720

  	 	Chapter subtitles: 
 By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:-1440
 	1.	Click on 93Assign Section Layouts94 at the bottom of the Compile panel.	2.	Select 93Chapter Heading94 in the list on the left.	3.	Select a different layout on the right, such as 93Chapter Title94. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)-720
 	 	
 Font:
  You can override the font used throughout a compiled document:-1440
 	1.	At the top of the 93Section Layouts94 pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the 93Font94 setting.	2.	Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however97e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The 93Font94 setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.-720
 	 	
 Page size: 
 The 93Paperback94 format is set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.0694 x 7.8194, which is one of the formats you can use with Amazon92s CreateSpace and is a popular size for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:-1440
 	1.	Ctrl-click on the 93Paperback (5.0694 x 7.81)94 format in Compile92s 93Formats94 list.	2.	Select 93Duplicate & Edit Format8594. The window will change size and content.	3.	In the 93Format Name94 text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. 93Paperback (694 x 994)94).	4.	Select 93Page Settings94 in the sidebar.	5.	Click on the 93Page Setup8594 button.	6.	In the 93Page Setup94 panel that appears, select 93Manage Custom Sizes8594 from the 93Paper Size94 pop-up button.	7.	Click the 93+94 button to add a new custom size and give it a name.	8.	Enter the paper width and height. (Note this is Apple92s standard Page Setup panel, and the units it displays are determined in System Preferences under 93Language & Region94 > 93Advanced8594.)	9.	Click 93OK94 and then click 93OK94 again.	10.	Click 93Save94 in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.-720
 	 	
 Making your own special folders:
  The 93Characters94 and 93Places94 folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.-1440
 	1.	To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents > Change Icon to choose a different icon.	2.	To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the 93Template Sheets94 folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.	3.	To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents > Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.-720
 	 	
 Working with chapters instead of scenes:
  By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don92t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:-1440
 	1.	Rename the 93Scene94 document to use your chapter title and move it so that it is on the same level as the 93Chapter94 folder rather than being inside it.	2.	Move the 93Chapter94 folder to the Trash.	3.	Create a new text document for each chapter.	4.	Go to Project > Project Settings and select 93Section Types94.	5.	Select the 93Default Types by Structure94 tab.	6.	Delete 93Level 1 files94 and 93Level 2 files and deeper94.	7.	In the 93Section Type94 column, change the setting for 93Root files94 to 93Chapter94, then hit 93OK94. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.-720
 	 	
 Using a custom table of contents in ebooks:
  When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:-1440
 	1.	Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.	2.	Name the document 93Contents94.	3.	In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Command to select more than one document).	4.	For a simple flat list, hit Cmd-C or use Edit > Copy. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, go to Edit > Copy Special > Copy Documents as Structured Link List.	5.	Click into the text of the 93Contents94 document and hit Cmd-V or use Edit > Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.	6.	If you intend to export to an older ebook format (ePub 2 or non-KF8 Mobi), select all of the text and change it to use a 12-point font.	7.	If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.	8.	In the Inspector, change the 93Section Type94 of the 93Contents94 document to 93Table of Contents94. Now, when you Compile, your custom 93Contents94 document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the 93Contents94 document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.
 
  Sample Documents
  The 93Sample Output94 folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. 93Standard Manuscript94 shows the results when compiling to 93Manuscript (Courier)94, and 93Paperback Novel94 shows the results when compiling to 93Paperback (5.0694 x 7.8194)94 format.
  Final Note
  Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the 93Blank94 template. We92ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a 93Blank94 project and setting it up yourself.You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File > Save As Template.

## Heliopolis

### Colossus

Palatino-Roman;
;;
;;

  The colossus of Rhodes, sixth wonder of the world, was said to straddle the waterway at one seagate of that ancient city of grain and sunlight. Rhodes, so named for its placeholder of placeholder, belonged to myth more than history. Its chroniclers used imagination more than appropriate. Later determined the Colossus very near certainly did not bestride the water, being virtually impossible to construct a statue of the dimensions required given the materials available at the time 97 not to mention the sheer lunacy needed to place a giant phallus hanging like the sword of Damocles above every aquatic entrant to the old city. Those facts of history interpreted by our Architect as a dare, you see now why that Damoclesian threat menaces our view as we peer up through the tinted glass pane of our submersible as we glide over the prime waterway at the entrance of Heliopolis, capital city of the Republic of Atlantis.For the Architect had grown accustomed over a period of decades before and during the birth of the Republic to being called lunatic and all manner of derision, he proclaimed on the first anniversary of the founding that Atlantis must do what all others had not, we must build higher and bolder, we must reach with our limbs and our hammers and our hopes for the skies, we must bestride the waters as that fancifully imagined Colossus never could. And so the height of those old drawings was studied and measured by court engineers and approximated to be two hundred meters in height, and so our Atlantean Colossus would be rounded up to an even 250 meters 97 and so there he stands.From the side panes he sees in the distance the wakes of other submersibles heading into the city as his craft leaves it. Soft blurs behind those far windows seem to be human chins raised and arms gesturing upward, likely new citizens making their first trip to the capital, mouths unavoidably agape as they behold one wonder of the new world.He was once such a young man, today a grizzled veteran of the waterways leaving at dawn as is his routine, off to the day92s labors at the thermal plant overseeing the pipeline repairs and upgrades. His work was rewarding, as a longtime roboticist to be granted foremanship of the largest thermal plant serving Heliopolis. The bots were the latest generation workers, fresh off the line of Atlantis Robotics, a prime state enterprise headquartered next sector over.Soft chimes sounded as his craft descended gradually just under the waves, and moments later he saw the lights of a pneumatic tube straight ahead blinking white and gold, blurred in the water. And then a soft hiss of vacuum as his craft sealed into the tube under the plant. Lights flicked by as the craft slowed to a stop, then rose as if in an aquatic elevator. The roof class hissed open and the lights and sounds of the tube station brought his attention to the present.He rose, stretched out his long frame, popped his neck as he stretched, and stepped out onto the landing pad. 93Campeos, Victor.94 his AI announced as scanbots gave him a once-over. 93Three new messages, one urgent.9493Show urgent.94A vid screen opened in the air in front of him, sound reverberating in the air beside it.93Anomaly in section eight. Report immediately.9493On my way,94 he said from habit, but only the bots heard him.Deepwater thermal plants reached commercial scale in the 2030s and dotted most of the earth's equator by the early 2040s. Victor's first job was repairing the sanitation bots that hadn't yet adapted to deep-ocean conditions. The early platforms were little more than slabs of concrete holding pipe and turbine along with small living quarters and a hut for miner-generators. He'd seen most the evolution from early days' platforms to the megastructures of today. Somewhere along the path of growth the platforms and plants became more creature than building. From the earliest days the platforms would spawn reefs of fish and coral and algae all up and down the pillars and pipes. And as standard concrete evolved to bio-concrete, and edges yielded to curves and sweeps and swirls, even the biomass seemed to thrill and hum with excitement at the growing symbiosis. As alive as the platforms felt, the internals still ran on the mechanical necessities of wiring and electricity. Bots were needed to maintain and upgrade most systems, and in those days the humans were needed to repair the bots.

  His first time in Heliopolis boggled the mind, challenging assumptions of what a city can be 97 and what feels even possible to do in the middle of the ocean. He walked down tree-lined boulevards, stopped in at sidewalk cafes, played minigolf, walked past shops and homes, white pillars raising from the ground everywhere 97 or, if he looked a little farther out, raising out of the water as if born from the sea itself.He sat on a terrace overlooking a marina facing an artificial bay set between the seagates. He enjoyed a steak, medium rare. Beef was one of the main imports of Atlantis, for the population had a hankering for beef. Expensive taste, yes. There were experimental platforms for raising beef cows but had not yet borne fruit, nothing comparable to what could be flown in. Some beef was shipped in but the best was flown in.He92d once been given a tour of the factory where they attempted growing lab-grown meat. Funny it actually did take off but the market for it just wasn92t there in Atlantis 97 too snobbish we all were 97 but in fact some of the neighboring countries ate it up. So that was one of our great exports.Atlantis had self-sufficiency in a number of things, power, 3D printing, growing greens, fishing, but not yet quality beef. A thriving import/export business dominated much of the countryside ports of Atlantis. He loved going down there to tour, and was always happy when he was asked to service a robot down there.

## Platforms

### Gulf

Palatino-Roman;
;;
;;

  I remember the first time we mounted an oil rig in the Gulf. One of those long abandoned platforms whose ownership and provenance were recorded on some musty piece of paper in a file long forgotten. It was ours now. We claimed it under Atlantis seasteading law. That was before other governments recognized us, so technically we were pirates. I suppose we still are. These platforms were abandoned to rust and decay decades before, unloved by anyone since. The first thing we did after mounting was gaze over the railing, careful not to lean too much or risk a rusty rail giving way. We imagined looking out on a thriving metropolis, bridges built between skyscrapers, all humming with energy pulled up from below.We unloaded from our speedboat a drum of concrete powder and that night built our first concrete brick. We made a campfire and danced and drank and made a big ruckus and then our leader said that it92s time. He made the usual speech, we placed the brick, declared that platform our capital, and thus we created contested waters. Recognition came later, as did the Navy and our first million citizens and victory in war and our space program and all the rest. For now there was just us, the brick, and the dusky waters of the Gulf.

## Space

### Untitled (28D9A2CE)

  Clustered at the Lagrange point between Earth and Luna were satellites and stations from terrestrial countries. USA and China had stations, the EU had a satellite. And Atlantis had a new sort of spacecraft. Part science vessel, part munitions depot, part spy satellite, the craft referred to only ever as Poseidon sat dormant for years until just now. An aperture on its earth-facing side now opens to reveal a lens. Deep beneath Heliopolis, Fleet Admiral Stellan Harper stands before a floor-to-ceiling screen covering one wall of the Atlantis Naval Command Center. Dominating the view is earth below, with split-screen panes on either side focusing on the other Lagrange craft. We see faint flags of US, EU, China. At the bank of terminals an officer says, 93Systems nominal, sir. Green for mission.94With no hesitation the Admiral commands, 93Fire.94Thirty small camera windows appear also on screen, first with views similar to the cameras fixed on the craft, but then the craft appear bigger. On the larger screen we see the faintest shadows of thirty small shapes arc out from Poseidon on curving trajectories out and splitting up toward each of the stations and satellites. They pick up speed and soon their camera views are filled with the gray metal of the crafts as they reach their targets. Targets are disabled on impact. Some of our swarm disable, some jam, some burrow into the hulls of the enemy crafts, blades cutting into metal. Some small screens become bigger as those minicraft board and now roam the decks or conduits of the disabled craft.One of the screens - marked as aboard the Chinese station Shouyu - abruptly cut out, its screen filled with gray static. 93Report.9493Unit 8 comms offline sir. Investigating with unit 9.94All eyes swing toward the camera of unit 9 as it rounds a corner. Immediately ahead is an 8-foot-tall yellow humanoid bot brandishing a raygun.93Is that85 a human faceplate?94 muses an officer.93Nuke nine,94 barks the Admiral.A white flash erupts on multiple screens as Shouyu disappears in a nuclear blast.93Response status?9493China cruiser en route, ETA 8 minutes. US repositioning but nothing inbound. EU chatter only.9493Other bees?9493Data dumps complete. Secondary targets missing.9493On my mark, nuke all. Commence phase two. Three. Two. One. Mark.94

## Library

### Untitled (7FAC5BF3)

Palatino-Roman;

  The background hum in the Library of Atlantis came from a chorus of priests ringing the perimeter, and together with the babbling of fountains and streams that ran in mini aqueducts along the walls and snaking up the classical columns formed the only sound aside from pages turning and AIs whispering. Second Librarian Ariadne Marcus had contact lenses in semantic glow mode and tuned to recent events. Her AIs collated and summarized documents that lit up with faint light as she worked her way through the police reports, a favor for the local constable, a friend of her husband. She rarely visited this section of the library as it required security clearance to view any of the documents. The passcode from the constable unlocked what she needed, and otherwise it was a normal workday: cup of tea in front of her, a small screen showing a livestream of her cat at home.She slammed her eyelids shut against a massive flash of light a few desks over. Reflex, she chided herself, remembering she could face no damage from the semantic glowlight from her contacts. But what was this! She had never seen so bright a glow. The glow lingered awhile over one table, marked in sigils as classified Above Top Secret, then settled on a drawer at the bottom. She had never seen this table used 97 and the cleanbots were instructed to stay away from it 97 so it had a unique layering of dust layered atop it. But that drawer? She tabbed to hide the glow a moment and zoomed in on the drawer. The one drawer with no dust. Had it been opened recently?Slowly standing, she resolved to look closer. Just then a catastrophe siren blared out among all nearby speakers. She looked around incredulously as other librarians and patrons walked briskly toward the exit. Are we under attack?She knew she should join the others in the shelters, but her gaze fell back on that drawer.

## History

### Untitled (68C82BF8)

Palatino-Roman;

  He first saw combat during the battle of Port Houston in 2031. By then most units of the Texas National Guard had been absorbed into the Texas State Guard where Victor served as lieutenant. He92d joined the State Guard originally out of a sense of civic duty to his neighbors, hoping to help in the aftermath of a hurricane or electric disaster like he92d experienced in his childhood. What began as a somewhat sleepy assignment took on new urgency as the Texas independence movement grew to attract mainstream support. The Texan schism of 2029 resulted in a split in the national guard as the more federalized units were recalled to other states and those loyal to Texas were merged into the state guard under command of the governor. While he92d come to know the NG guys  a bit from sharing a base at Camp Mabry in Austin, there92d always been a bit of a culture clash between the active-duty soldiers and the part-time volunteers in the State Guard. He92d always envied the extra discipline and kit and mission and rigor of the full-timers. Exciting then to see his own force strengthened with their ranks. It gave him permission to lean more into going pro himself, seeing himself as a man on a mission, part of a stronger force on a righteous path to victory.Federal forces had fortified Houston as their staging area for moving war materiel into the state. By 2030 most of the highways had been claimed by Texan independents, with drone overflights paired with rapid-deployment guerrillas preventing federal incursion by land across most of the state. The feds primarily controlled the Texan coast. You might call it naval superiority if Texas had any navy to be superior over: it was just that the feds had complete dominance of the waters as Texas had no naval assets. The tens of thousands of coastal Texan fatalities as a result certainly stuck in everyone92s mind when the Texas-Atlantis treaty was negotiated in the following years. Not quite naval, but Texas did have a few aquatic assets worth mentioning. Redneck pirates they jokingly called themselves, and they92d successfully harassed the fed shipments into the port enough that a new wave of reinforcements had just been sent to stave them off. One day they made the mistake of staging along the port in snipers92 distance from an old bank tower a mile away. Independents had a patron who was a major tenant of the building and occasionally let them use it as a headquarters. So here was Victor laying along a ramshackle snipers92 nest on the twentieth floor of a skycraper, training his scope on a detachment of feds unloading trucks at the port a mile away. 93Bogeys in sight.9493Your choice,94 replied his commander with binoculars. 93Make it symbolic.94Two feds hoisted a munitions crate between them. No doubt intended to replenish their ships with bullets intended for his brothers in arms.Heeyed his scope, muttered under his breath, 93How about two birds one stone?94 lined up, and put a single round through the head of both feds at once.

  There came a point after China invaded Taiwan where the US seemed to realize its weak position. The decay of its naval fleet, the debt held by adversaries, its inability to build new ships or munitions without depending on their advesaries, the weak and fragile supply chain. When the US was pressured off the world stage. And what made the US empire work was its navy, and that pulled back toward its shores. Rust buckets.

  The first he heard about Atlantis was from a friend who texted him a link to an underground forum post. His friend would send him all manner of crazy conspiracy theories and such over the years, so he never attached much weight to any one thing. He looked at it briefly:Subject: what the fuck is thisBody: which of you schizos is making an ocean armyAttachment: ANAreqs.pdfHe opened the attachment:ATLANTIS NAVAL ACADEMY ENTRY REQUIREMENTS - 100 snatches in 5 minutes with 24kg kettlebell- Tread water for 60 minutes- 5km ocean swim in under 90 minutesHe stopped reading. Probably some fanfic or joke he didn92t get. And on the off chance it was some legit something, there was no way he92d be able to meet those requirements. He92d joined the state guard in part because it checked his box of letting him make friends while serving his neighbors without being too demanding physically. He was in okay shape but wouldn92t be able to do anything to let him join some Atlantis navy. Hah. He alt-tabbed back to his video game.

  He had to search the web for how to do a kettlebell snatch. He started with a 16kg bell. Started slow, made some mistakes, pulled a muscle once, but gradually learned how to do it. Then he started counting, and he kept a log. Four snatches today. Eight snatches. Twelve. Twenty. When he got to 100 with the 16kg he repeated the process with 20, then again with 24.Every time he looked in the mirror he seemed to get leaner, meaner, sharper.For addiction training he looked up tips on a few forums linked from that original post he dug up. Some conflicting advice from various people trying different things trying to meet the criteria. Some advice that resonated with him was, drink a lot of water 97 more than you think you should. Go keto, go carnivore, eat carbs, eat fruit, eat vegetables, eat no vegetables, eat supplements, eat no supplements, hmm. One thing that worked was doing intermittent fasting. Brought blood sugar to even levels.

  Jack circled his opponent, hands out in front of him, gaze locked. He lunged high - a feint - and dove down to capture ankles for a takedown. Seconds later he had the tap and stood up in victory. A few scattered cheers from classmates. A quick scan of the crowd and he thought he caught a long admiring glance from Rona, a beautiful girl he92d been crushing on for months. He looked again and she92d turned away. Wishful thinking?Class ended and he stepped out onto the deck, leaning against the railing. He92d just turned 17 years old and was still getting used to his new height after a growth spurt. Lost in thought, he struck a pose, something that made him feel epic, maybe he saw it in a movie. A giggle came from behind him and he whirled. Rona stood there smiling shyly. 93What are you doing?94Scoffed, trying to play cool. 93Being awesome. What are you doing?94She also leaned at the railing and looked out at the roiling ocean waters. She took a deep breath.93Trying to take it all in before I go. I92m going to miss it here.9493You92re going to Austin Station?9493For an internship, yes. Lasts six months 97 unless they hate me and kick me out.9493No way. You92ll be running the place in three.94 He looked at her sidelong. 93You should take me with you.94Her cheeks flushed red, almost responding as if it weren92t a joke, then gave a short chuckle. 93You92re funny.9493Well at least let me buy you dinner before you go.9493Leaving in the morning, got to go pack. Raincheck?94 He smiled shyly, not fully sure he wasn92t being blown off.93Hug?94 93I suppose so,94 he guffawed.She gave him a warm embrace, and a quick kiss on the cheek.93Goodbye for now. Keep your guard up,94 she said over her shoulder as she turned and walked away.93I will.94

  Jack sat at a table near the back of the library reading a book about chi kung, specifically opening your microcosmic orbit. Another book on the table was 91The Multiorgasmic Man92. 93So you92re into fiction, Jack?94Jack startled to see a beautiful young woman in front of him.93Rona?94

  They walked along the pier sipping tea under a full moon overhead. Statues topping the pier columns seemed to gaze at them under shadowed visage, darkly white in the moonlight. They talked of academics and dreams and sea life and wild fantasies. On the horizon he saw speedboats coming and going, cargo ships lumbering, speeders cutting here and there. But here he felt they walked alone in a moonlit bubble, just them and the profusion of coral and algae and fish below. After a pause she stopped walking and declared, 93We need to swim.9493Yeah, but I92m not quite dressed for it.94She laughed and in one motion pulled her dress over her head, her exposed breasts drawing his wide-eyed gaze. 93I am,94 she laughed and dove off the pier.93Ah shit.94 He stripped off shirt and pants and dove to follow.Together they swam through the coral reef, soft lights dotting the pillars the only illumination. In the distance they caught glimpse of bioluminescence, faint blue and green. Wordlessly she slipped one hand into his, other arm leaning off one mossy pillar. He floated closer, eyes locked on hers. He wrapped one arm around her waist and pulled her to him. Their lips met, tongues exploring then swirling deeply for moments - an eternity - then she pulled back and laughed with joy. She dunked her head down and pushed against the pillar, darting out deeper into the water, turning up at the last minute to face him as she surfaced. 93Well? Come on.94 He followed her out. She faced the distant blues just under the horizon. He came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her, kicking powerfully to keep them both afloat as he pulled her hips onto his. She looked up over her shoulder at him, whispering, 93Can you keep me afloat?94 He cradled her face with one hand and pulled her body around to face him. He faced her with his whole being, eyes on hers. 93I want you. I want this.9493Just for now?94 93For all time.94She turned away, keeping hold of his hand, pulling him back toward the pillars. A stone staircase rose out of the water. She sat on it facing him, wrapping her legs around him. Another deep kiss, and she pushed him back, gazed ruefully over his shoulder, into her thoughts. 93You know, Jack, I am first generation here.9493I know. I979493Wait.94 She took a breath. 93Ever since I was a girl I dreamed of this place, of cradling my child and listening to the waves beat against the pillar reefs. Can you imagine my longing? I hesitate to share this with you because97 I92m afraid I may want this more than you do.94His heart near burst out of his chest. He stroked her cheek. 93I am here,94 he swept his arm across the vista of the pillars and the city in the distance, 93to build a legacy. A dynasty to last generations. To place my mark on this place, on seas and stars.94 She felt his fiery gaze pierced through to her soul. 93I would be honored to share this journey with you.94 She smiled and wrapped her legs around him tighter, brought her lips to his ear. 93Show me then.94

## Academy

  The world92s greatest military academy began like some mail-order business. Correspondence delivered by letter, even starting with snail mail. You had to express interest by filling out a form online and mailing it somewhere, and then waiting to hear nack in the mail. Sometimes letters never came. When they did, they were brusque.93Campeos, Victor. Application provisionally accepted conditional on evidence of entry requirements. Upload instructions on next page.94Fifteen years later he strode the gleaming white halls of the Academy headquarters in Heliopolis. He liked to take a winding route to class, detouring to pass through the plaza, on the fourth and top floor so he could look down at all the students and faculty lounging or walkig through. Center to the great vaulted room was a massive statue of an anonymous man and woman called The Students, art deco statue of two students looking upward, pen and paper in hand. As professor of combat robotics he worked with graduate students on capstone projects. He pushed on double doors and entered an auditorium, like the ancient Roman amphitheatres, with a wide circular skylight atop a bio-concrete dome. The seats looked modern, with tablets at each. Twelve students were there now milling around.93Take your seats everyone. First two students to the front.94 A screen dropped down and onscreen was some outdoor arena many kilometers away, in which two robots stood face to face. One had missile launcher, one had some ray gun. Cries of 93You can do it94 and various insults followed the two students as they walked down the aisle to the control rigs at the front. A three-light diagram appeared over the screen, red lit up. 93Battle one commences in three, two, one.94 The light flicked from red to yellow to green and the distant robots roared to life, their rumbling echoing through the classroom as if the students were there at the arena. Cheers as each blow landed.

## America

  What a few smart people started calling an American renaissance circa 2024 with high hopes for the Trump administration went off the rails a few short years later. It became clear that the institutional corruption of the American decline was not reversible, at least not using the methods available to the Trump administration and MAGA movement.Monetary policy became important, Ron Paul laughed from his grave, as trillions and trillions of dollars were spent to cover holes in the US balance sheet stemming from the corrective measures taken to fight recession in the aftermath of the third world war.It was hoped that because Trump92s first term had no new wars begin that Trump was the best shot at avoiding a new world war. We92ll never know if that would have turned out differently but the fact is that the escalation after the China invasion of Taiwan was too steep for Trump or maybe any one person to manage. The US made noise and bluster about it but ended up withdrawing its assets from the region and leaving Taiwan to its fate. Fortunately most of the vital industry US cared about had already been relocated to the US or elsewhere out of the reach of the communists. The TSMC plant in Arizona was humming along, not quite up to par with its Taiwan counterpart but getting better every month.The first shots of the Second American Civil War were fired on November 6
  th
  , 2024, the day after election day. The electoral college was deadlocked 269-269 and accusations of voter fraud ran rampant. A polling center in Georgia that banned outside observers was forcibly entered by MAGA people. Cops came and as usual made a hamhanded response that killed an unarmed Republican election observer. This led to a surge of armed MAGA folk descending on every ballot counting site in every contested race. Georgia had been called for Harris but Republican lawyers were furiously challenging the result. It looked like a replay of 2020 shenanigans but now with the entire MAGA movement watching the state like a hawk, their social media networks and journalist apparatus buoyed by years of buildout and millions of American and global watchers excited for non-mainstream views.

## Antarctica

  Jambo was a founding member of the Atlantis Navy Antarctic Division. He was born in Argentina and did time in the Argentine navy spending time shuttling back and forth between the southern tip of Argnentina and their Antarctic base. Others on the team were engineers or shipbuilders and the like, he was just an adventurous navy rat who had a skyhigh cold tolerance and a love for desolate places. He was on the first recon mission from Atlantis, sending one of their new Aurora-class icebreaker  ubs. It was all experimental as pretty much every new tech was in Atlantis, experimental meaning hey this might work or you might die quickly or you might die slowly. Can92t have a bleeding-edge frontier without some blood along the way, but that92s all okay with Jambo. Relations with McMurdo were85 frosty, you could say. Though some in our Antarctic division were currently or formerly Americans also, that didn92t seem to ingratiate them with the McMurdo authorities who, following the US State Department92s lead, had come to relate to Atlanteans with stony standoffishness, cold but not scornful, like hoping hard if Atlantis were ignored they92d disappear. But when Atlantis did actually show up in a meaningful way, like showing up on the radar and in the waters America thought they should have dominion over, things could get interesting.The first incident came after Jambo92s ship Borealis surfaced a few kilometers off McMurdo. They92d intended to keep a certain distance away from the cle	arly delineated American presence at McMurdo Station but inadvertently surfaced within sight of an American research site where apparently some McMurdo scientists were investigating a marine ecosystem (or so they claimed). The radio crackled to life. 93Unidentified vessel, this is McMurdo Station Control. You have entered a protected research zone. Please identify yourself and state your purpose.94Jambo smirked and replied, 93No ingle9s.94More insistent: 93Unidentified vessel, identify yourself now.9493Borealis speaking, Atlantis Navy. Just on our way to deliver some pizzas. Y92all take care now.94A pause, then a different and more stern voice:93Borealis, be advised that your presence here violates Article 3 of the Antarctic Treaty. You are required to provide advance notice of all activities in this region.9493Funny I don92t remember signing any such treaty. G92bye now.94We later found out that two vessels from the U.S. Military Sealift Command were diverted to us on an intercept course. Within minutes, the first of the vessels appeared on our scopes, and then its hulking form emerged from the mist. 93Unregistered vessel Borealis, this is Captain Richards of the USNS Capable. Your presence here is unauthorized. You are advised to depart immediately.94
