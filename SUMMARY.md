## WORLD OF ATLANTIS

### **The Republic**
Built entirely on ocean platforms connected by underwater pneumatic tubes and submersible transportation networks. The capital city **Heliopolis** is crowned by a 250-meter Colossus that straddles the main waterway, paying homage to the ancient Colossus of Rhodes while demonstrating Atlantean engineering supremacy.

### **Technology & Environment**
- **Bio-concrete architecture** that curves organically and supports thriving marine ecosystems
- **Thermal energy systems** drawing power from deep ocean sources
- **Advanced robotics** for construction, maintenance, and combat operations
- **Integrated marine agriculture** that makes the city a living reef system
- **Space warfare capabilities** including swarm robotics and nuclear weapons

### **Society & Governance**
The Republic operates as a militarized democracy with classical influences, featuring:
- Rigorous physical requirements for naval service
- Academy system training specialists in combat robotics and oceanic engineering
- Import/export economy balancing luxury goods (imported beef) with technological exports
- Classical architectural aesthetic evoking Greek and Roman civilizations

## PLOT STRUCTURE

### **Part I: The Collapse (2024-2030s)**
The narrative opens with the disintegration of American democracy during a contested 2024 election, leading to the Second American Civil War. As China invades Taiwan and the US retreats from global leadership due to naval decay and economic crisis, alternative power structures begin to emerge.

### **Part II: Texas Independence (2029-2031)**
Victor Campeos serves in the Texas State Guard during their war for independence, participating in pivotal battles like Port Houston. These conflicts demonstrate the breakdown of traditional federal authority and the rise of regional powers.

### **Part III: Birth of Atlantis**
Seasteaders claim abandoned Gulf of Mexico oil platforms under "Atlantis seasteading law," initially operating as self-acknowledged pirates. The founding moment crystallizes when they place a single concrete brick and declare their platform as capital, establishing territorial sovereignty in international waters.

### **Part IV: The Republic Rises**
Atlantis evolves from a collection of platforms into a sophisticated ocean-based civilization with advanced technology, international recognition, and growing military power. The development of bio-concrete cities that integrate with marine ecosystems marks a new form of environmental architecture.

### **Part V: Space Supremacy**
The climax reveals Atlantis's achievement of space warfare dominance, as Fleet Admiral Harper commands the destruction of US, Chinese, and EU space stations from the Lagrange point, establishing Atlantean control of orbital space.
