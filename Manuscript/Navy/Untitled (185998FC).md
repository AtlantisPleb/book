Palatino-Roman; The first he heard about Atlantis was from a friend who texted him a link to an underground forum post. His friend would send him all manner of crazy conspiracy theories and such over the years, so he never attached much weight to any one thing. He looked at it briefly: Subject: what the fuck is this Body: which of you schizos is making an ocean army Attachment: ANAreqs.pdf He opened the attachment: ATLANTIS NAVAL ACADEMY ENTRY REQUIREMENTS - 100 snatches in 5 minutes with 24kg kettlebell - Tread water for 60 minutes - 5km ocean swim in under 90 minutes He stopped reading. Probably some fanfic or joke he didn't get. And on the off chance it was some legit something, there was no way he'd be able to meet those requirements. He'd joined the state guard in part because it checked his box of letting him make friends while serving his neighbors without being too demanding physically. He was in okay shape but wouldn't be able to do anything to let him join some Atlantis navy. Hah. He alt-tabbed back to his video game.
