Palatino-Roman; His first time in Heliopolis boggled the mind, challenging assumptions of what a city can be — and what feels even possible to do in the middle of the ocean. He walked down tree-lined boulevards, stopped in at sidewalk cafes, played minigolf, walked past shops and homes, white pillars raising from the ground everywhere — or, if he looked a little farther out, raising out of the water as if born from the sea itself. He sat on a terrace overlooking a marina facing an artificial bay set between the seagates. He enjoyed a steak, medium rare. Beef was one of the main imports of Atlantis, for the population had a hankering for beef. Expensive taste, yes. There were experimental platforms for raising beef cows but had not yet borne fruit, nothing comparable to what could be flown in. Some beef was shipped in but the best was flown in. He'd once been given a tour of the factory where they attempted growing lab-grown meat. Funny it actually did take off but the market for it just wasn't there in Atlantis — too snobbish we all were — but in fact some of the neighboring countries ate it up. So that was one of our great exports. Atlantis had self-sufficiency in a number of things, power, 3D printing, growing greens, fishing, but not yet quality beef. A thriving import/export business dominated much of the countryside ports of Atlantis. He loved going down there to tour, and was always happy when he was asked to service a robot down there.
