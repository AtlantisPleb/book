Palatino-Roman; He first saw combat during the battle of Port Houston in 2031. By then most units of the Texas National Guard had been absorbed into the Texas State Guard where Victor served as lieutenant. He'd joined the State Guard originally out of a sense of civic duty to his neighbors, hoping to help in the aftermath of a hurricane or electric disaster like he'd experienced in his childhood. What began as a somewhat sleepy assignment took on new urgency as the Texas independence movement grew to attract mainstream support. The Texan schism of 2029 resulted in a split in the national guard as the more federalized units were recalled to other states and those loyal to Texas were merged into the state guard under command of the governor. While he'd come to know the NG guys a bit from sharing a base at Camp Mabry in Austin, there'd always been a bit of a culture clash between the active-duty soldiers and the part-time volunteers in the State Guard. He'd always envied the extra discipline and kit and mission and rigor of the full-timers. Exciting then to see his own force strengthened with their ranks. It gave him permission to lean more into going pro himself, seeing himself as a man on a mission, part of a stronger force on a righteous path to victory. Federal forces had fortified Houston as their staging area for moving war materiel into the state. By 2030 most of the highways had been claimed by Texan independents, with drone overflights paired with rapid-deployment guerrillas preventing federal incursion by land across most of the state. The feds primarily controlled the Texan coast. You might call it naval superiority if Texas had any navy to be superior over: it was just that the feds had complete dominance of the waters as Texas had no naval assets. The tens of thousands of coastal Texan fatalities as a result certainly stuck in everyone's mind when the Texas-Atlantis treaty was negotiated in the following years. Not quite naval, but Texas did have a few aquatic assets worth mentioning. Redneck pirates they jokingly called themselves, and they'd successfully harassed the fed shipments into the port enough that a new wave of reinforcements had just been sent to stave them off. One day they made the mistake of staging along the port in snipers' distance from an old bank tower a mile away. Independents had a patron who was a major tenant of the building and occasionally let them use it as a headquarters. So here was Victor laying along a ramshackle snipers' nest on the twentieth floor of a skycraper, training his scope on a detachment of feds unloading trucks at the port a mile away. "Bogeys in sight." "Your choice," replied his commander with binoculars. "Make it symbolic." Two feds hoisted a munitions crate between them. No doubt intended to replenish their ships with bullets intended for his brothers in arms. Heeyed his scope, muttered under his breath, "How about two birds one stone?" lined up, and put a single round through the head of both feds at once.
