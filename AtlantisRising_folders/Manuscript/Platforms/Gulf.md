### Gulf

Palatino-Roman; I remember the first time we mounted an oil rig in the Gulf. One of those long abandoned platforms whose ownership and provenance were recorded on some musty piece of paper in a file long forgotten. It was ours now. We claimed it under Atlantis seasteading law. That was before other governments recognized us, so technically we were pirates. I suppose we still are. These platforms were abandoned to rust and decay decades before, unloved by anyone since. The first thing we did after mounting was gaze over the railing, careful not to lean too much or risk a rusty rail giving way. We imagined looking out on a thriving metropolis, bridges built between skyscrapers, all humming with energy pulled up from below. We unloaded from our speedboat a drum of concrete powder and that night built our first concrete brick. We made a campfire and danced and drank and made a big ruckus and then our leader said that it's time. He made the usual speech, we placed the brick, declared that platform our capital, and thus we created contested waters. Recognition came later, as did the Navy and our first million citizens and victory in war and our space program and all the rest. For now there was just us, the brick, and the dusky waters of the Gulf.
